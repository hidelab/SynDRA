Methods

Data Sources

To construct a unified and comprehensive drug synonym database, we integrated four independent data sources:

KatDB Synonyms

Source: Developed by Kat Koler

File: L1000_BRD_name_translated_drug_list.csv

Description: This dataset includes multiple synonyms per BROAD compound identifier, designed to improve drug name recognition in L1000 experiments.

Example: The BROAD_drug_ID "BRD-K52256627" includes synonyms ranging from “chlorhexidine” to complex chemical names.

Therapeutic Targets Database (TTD)

URL: TTD Full Download

File: P1-04-Drug_synonyms.txt

Description: The TTD provides drug synonym lists associated with therapeutic targets, useful for pharmacological research.

Example: Drug ID “D00AAN” includes synonyms like “d00aan” and various chemical descriptors.

PRISM Drug Synonyms

URL: PRISM GitHub Repository

File: PRISM_drug_synonyms.csv

Description: Derived from the PRISM repurposing screen, this file supports mechanism-of-action enrichment.

Example: PubChem_CID 11314340 is associated with multiple synonyms such as “a-674563”.

LINCS 2020 Compound Metadata

File: compoundinfo_beta.txt

URL: https://clue.io/releases/data-dashboard

Path: /data/work/tolga/Signature_processing_and_drug_prioritisation/analysis/synonym_database/input/LINCS2020/

Description: Contains compound identifiers and names used in the L1000 assay from Clue.io.

Data Preparation

To ensure consistency, the following normalization steps were applied:

All synonyms were converted to lowercase.

Multi-synonym strings were split into individual entries.

Extraneous whitespace and formatting artifacts were stripped.

This preprocessing allowed for standardized comparisons and merging across sources.

Merging Strategy

The integration of the synonym datasets followed a multi-step pipeline:

Synonym Explosion

All datasets were exploded on the synonym field to ensure one synonym per row.

Outer Join on Synonyms

Datasets were merged using an outer join based on the synonym column to maximize retention of unique entries.

ID Propagation Across Matches

Within synonym-sharing groups, identifiers (BROAD_drug_ID, TTD_drug_ID, PubChem_CID) were forward- and backward-filled to propagate known associations and unify partial matches.

Grouping and Aggregation

Merged records were grouped using a composite key derived from the concatenated identifiers. Synonyms were then aggregated within each group.

Dropping the rows with missing BROAD_drug_ids

Since our main interest was the LINCS platform for repurposing. We dropped rows where BROAD_drug_ids were NaN in the resulting df.
